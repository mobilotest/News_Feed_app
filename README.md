# News Feed app

The goal is to create a News Feed app I made for #UdacityLevelUp. 
It gives a user regularly-updated news from the Internet related to a particular topic, person, or location. The presentation of the information as well as the topic is up to you.

## Why this project?
In the most recent portion of the Nanodegree program, you worked to build the News app. Along the way, you learned about connecting to the Internet in Android, parsing responses from an API, updating the information in your app, and properly displaying that information. Practicing these skills is imperative in order to build apps that delight and surprise users by anticipating their needs and supplying them with relevant information.

## What will I learn?
This project is about combining various ideas and skills weâ€™ve been practicing throughout the course. They include:

## Connecting to an API
Parsing the JSON response
Handling error cases gracefully
Updating information regularly
Using an AsyncTask
Doing network operations independent of the Activity lifecycle
Use Uri.Builder class to add query parameters to the URL

### TBD in near future:
1. The next step will be the sorting news by category and days.
2. Next I want to change the colors of section's text
3. Add an Update button on the AppBar
